If you want your assignment to be counted as late (with 2%/hour penalty), you must send us (both Aaron and Danny) a message on Teams when you are ready for it to be counted as submitted. Be sure not to make changes after you make that request; any subsequent changes will be ignored (based on CoCalc's version tracking/Time Travel).\n",

    "This data file is from a **Flanker experiment** like the one described in the section [Spreadsheets](https://neuraldatascience.io/2/spreadsheets.html) in Chapter 2 of the textbook.  In this experiment, participants had to press either the left or right arrow key to indicate whether an arrow shown on the screen is pointing left or right, respectively. However, the catch is that the centre arrow is \"flanked\" by two other arrows on each side; these can be pointing the same way as the target arrow (**congruent**): \n",

The function `pd.read_csv()` assumes that the input you give it is a CSV (comma-separated values) file, which uses commas to separate the entries in each row that should be in separate columns. However, our text files use tabs, rather than commas, to separate the columns. We can tell this because in the output above, the lines all have a bunch of \"`\\t`\"s in them. The string `\\t` is a special code used in many programming languages (and Unix/linux systems) to indicate a tab. The backslash (`\\`) is a special **escape character** that tells Python not to interpret the next character literally as a string, but as a code.\n",

You'll see that there's an optional argument, `sep=`, along with a note that pandas assumes by default that columns are separated by commas. To override this default, we need to use `sep='\\t'`. \n",

    "You'll also see that there is a `block` column, which has a value of `practice` for all of the first 10 rows, and a `trial` column that increases sequentially. Many experiments are composed of a series of blocks, which are sets of trials. Blocks might simply be a way of setting up the experiment so that there are breaks (e.g., a break at the end of every block of trials), or the blocks may represent different experimental conditions. At any rate, you can infer from these columns that the experiment that generated these data was organized into blocks and trials. You can also likely guess that after the `practice` block are additional blocks, probably not called \"practice\". You can confirm this by calling the head of the DataFrame again, but this time showing more rows.\n",

    "1. Leave these as-is.\n",
    "2. Remove all rows with missing data\n",
    "3. Replace (impute) the missing values with actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation of missing data is sometimes done in psychology and neuroscience studies, especially if we have lots of variables, and only one data point per subject (e.g., a score on a standardized test completed by each subject). Usually the reason for imputing data is that statistical methods such as ANOVAs do not allow for missing data, so without imputation we might have to discard a subject's entire data set, even if they are only missing data from one test among many that were administered.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the current case, it doesn't make sense to impute (which is essentially guessing) a reaction time on a trial when a participant didn't make a response at all. So we could remove those trials entirely. On the other hand, we might want to report how many trials, on average, our participants failed to respond to, or we might want to treat them as errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although missing data is problematic for things like ANOVAs, it is not an issue for EDA summary statistics in pandas. pandas is written to gracefully handle missing data. Indeed, [pandas' documentation explicitly states](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#calculations-with-missing-data) that missing data is ignored in computing values such as the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we could probably safely keep the `NaN`s in the data. On the other hand, pandas does offer a `.dropna()` method, so this is a great opportunity to [learn to use it](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html)! \n",

That is to say, there are typically an equal number (and distribution) of values above and below the mean. RTs tend to be skewed, because there are fundamental limits on how fast a human can process information and make a motor response, which sets a lower limit on RTs. In some experiments, participants can wait as long as they want to make a response. In other experiments, there is a limited response window, but in both cases there tends to be a wider tail on the right side of the distribution, when you plot it. \n",

This is because many conventional statistical tests, like *t*-tests and ANOVAs, assume that the data are normally distributed. Using skewed data can cause unreliable results. \n",

This gives us a better sense of the distribution of the data and how all of it impacts the results, rather than just a single number (the mean). Measures of spread generally give a better visual understanding than measures of central tendencies.\n",
    "2. The distribution of values in each flanker condition is slightly larger on the log RT plot than the ms RT plot. I believe that it is easier to see possible differences between conditions because the error bars are similar, that way looking at the box plots is more telling of the summary statistics.\n",
    "3. We can conclude from the 2 plots that the reaction times are different between the flanker conditions. We can also conclude that there is more variation in reaction times for incongruent flankers than for congruent flankers."
