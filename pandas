# How to read in files using the pandas library

The stored data that we work with while coding is typically formated as a csv. Having a way to read in this data is critical to being able to use it! Luckily, the pandas library helps us do just that (along with many other things).

Below is an example of how I have used the pandas library to read in a csv file, as well as use its arguments and functions to make the data more usable.
